# ConnectFourGame_OB

|Plan of Attack|

Basic Needs/Thoughts
[X] 2 Players 
[X] Chip/Token respresentation of players
[] Board Component...use existing image or manually build out boxes to house chips
[] Way to restart the game once a player gets 4 in a row
[] Winner toggle?
[] Method to reset game...Automatically reset once 4 have been connected or offer button to user?
[X] Player to always start game (fairness...should it be random?)
[] State: Players, winner (maybe), manually built array of boxes (IF not using existing image), initial start value?, game over boolean?
[] Winning logic: Horizontal, Vertical, DiagonalL, Diagonal R, TIE!!
[] switch gameover boolean to true in win/tie logic for each scenario 
[] selected cell to drop must recognize how many chips are already present


|Extra tech|
[X] images of tokens/chips
[] possible image of connect4 board
[] Animations

|Stretch|
[] random number generator and even or odd function for p1 and p2 to have random player start each time?  Worth it?
